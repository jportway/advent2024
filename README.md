This is just my code for Advent of Code 2024.
This is just for fun, not competitive. If you have a quick look at it you'll soon realise I"m not aiming for sub-20 second times.
My days of waking up at 5am are over (I have never woken up at 5am).

I have no idea whether any of these solutions are optimal, or even particularly good code, mostly i was just aiming to have fun and try different approaches. Perhaps these will be useful examples to someone else - even if it's an example of what not to do. 

Also, at Day 20 my family insisted that I had more pressing responsibilities, so the fun ends there (I have a six year old daughter who views the sight of me sitting at a computer as an affront to her supremacy and a challenge to her persuasive power). Maybe, in the very unlikely event that I have some free time (again - I have a six year old daughter), I'll do the last few puzzles, but for now those will have to remain a tantalising possibility.
